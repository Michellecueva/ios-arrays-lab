## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.
``` swift 

var colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]

print("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]) and \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors")

```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.
``` swift 
`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`

westernStates.removeSubrange(4...5)

print(westernStates)
```

## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**
``` swift 

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`

for (index,character) in moreStates.enumerated() {
    if moreStates[index] == "Hawaii" || moreStates[index] == "Alaska" {
        print("\(character): not in the continental United States")
        continue
    }
    
    print("\(character): in the continental United States")
}

```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:
``` swift 

let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"

let myStringArr = Array(myString)
var space = " "
var count = 0

for (word) in myStringArr {
    if String(word) != space {
        count += 1
    }
}

print(count)

```

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.
``` swift

let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

for (_, sent) in myFavoriteQuotes.enumerated() {
    print(sent.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "").count) 

}

```

## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()

var flowerCount = 0
var flower = "ðŸŒ·"


for (index, element) in garden.enumerated() {
    if element == flower {
        basket.append(flower)
        garden[index] = "dirt"
    }
}

print("\(basket.count) flowers in basket")

```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.
``` swift

var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]

battingLineup.append("Suzuki")

battingLineup[1] = "Tejada"

battingLineup[5] = "Guerrero"

battingLineup.remove(at: 0)

battingLineup.insert("Reyes", at: 7)

print(battingLineup)

```
## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false


var numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

var target: Int = 32

var doesItContain = false

for i in numbers {
    if i == target {
        doesItContain = true
        break
    }
}

print(doesItContain)

```


## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift

let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.

var largestValue = arrayOfNumbers[0]

for i in arrayOfNumbers {
    if i > largestValue {
        largestValue = i
    }
}

print(largestValue)

```


## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift

let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.

var smallestValue = arrayOfNumbers[0]

for i in arrayOfNumbers {
    if i < smallestValue{
        smallestValue = i
    }
}

print(smallestValue)

```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.
``` swift

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`

for i in secondListOfNumbers where i % 2 == 1 {
    print(i)
}



```


## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

``` swift

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

var sum = 0

for i in thirdListOfNumbers {
    sum += i
}

print(sum)

```
## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.
``` swift
`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

var sum = 0

for i in thirdListOfNumbers where i % 2 == 0 {
    sum += i
}

print(sum)

```
## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()

for i in listOne {
    for j in listTwo {
        if (i == j) && !sharedElements.contains(i)  {
            sharedElements.append(i)
        }
    }
}

print(sharedElements.count)

```


## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []

for i in dupeFriendlyList {
    if noDupeList.contains(i) {
        continue
}
    noDupeList.append(i)
}

print(noDupeList)
```

## Question 15

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints
``` swift
`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`

let sortedArrayOfNumbers = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
var secondSmallestValue = sortedArrayOfNumbers[0]

for i in sortedArrayOfNumbers where i > secondSmallestValue {
    secondSmallestValue = i
    break
}

print(secondSmallestValue)

```


## Question 16

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. 

```
var range = 1..<1000
var holdNum: [Int] = []
var sum = 0

for i in range where (i % 3 == 0) || (i % 5 == 0) {
    holdNum.append(i)
    sum += i
}

print(sum)

```

var addElement: [Int] = []
var addElementsTwice: [Int] = []
var addElementsMoreTwice: [Int] = []

for i in someRepeatsAgain {
    if addElement.contains(i) && !addElementsTwice.contains(i) {
        addElementsTwice.append(i)
        continue
    }
    if addElementsTwice.contains(i) && !addElementsMoreTwice.contains(i) {
        addElementsMoreTwice.append(i)
        continue
    }
    addElement.append(i)
}

print(addElementsMoreTwice)
```


## Question 18
